# Fake News Detection Using TF-IDF Vectorizer
## Overview

This project implements a fake news detection system using a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features and a machine learning classifier to predict the authenticity of news articles. The aim is to classify news articles as either real or fake.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project should contain news articles labeled as real or fake. The dataset should be in CSV format with at least two columns:

    text: The text content of the news article.
    label: The label indicating whether the news is real or fake (e.g., 1 for real, 0 for fake).

You can use any publicly available fake news dataset or create your own.

Preprocessing steps involve:

    Loading the data: Read the CSV file containing the news articles.
    Text cleaning: Remove any unwanted characters, stopwords, and perform tokenization.
    TF-IDF Vectorization: Convert the text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorizer.


## Model Training

Train a machine learning classifier using the TF-IDF features. You can use various classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, etc.
